# Hello World! I'm Sarah.
I am a fullstack web developer from Akron, Ohio that specializes in creating the front end elements on web applications and translating web designs into websites using JavaScript and WordPress. I teach kids how to code at Coding with Kids, an organization that teaches kids coding concepts. 

I have 9 years of mentoring and differentating curriculum to fit individual learning styles. I'm looking to transition into a full time remote front end role that helps businesses get online faster and easily connect with the customers they want to work with.

## About Sarah 
‚úçÔ∏è I have managed 3 blogs from 2015 - 2021. Some of the blogs I've managed are The Original BritishPandaChick, BritishPandaChick Codes, and Needlework Kits. Today I write posts on DEV. You can follow me on [DEV](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc).

üíö I served as the moderator of Elphas Can Code from 2019 - 2022. Elphas Can Code was an online community on Elpha where all Elpha members learning to code can talk and support each other as they learn how to code.

üè∞ I created the Disney Codes Challenge in 2019. Disney Codes Challenge is a 57 day coding challenge where developers build projects inspired by Disney each day for 23 minutes. If you are interested in doing the challenge, you can share your progress using the hashtag #DisneyCodesChallenge. You can learn more about this challenge with this [post](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-disney-codes-challenge-3ojb).

üßµ You can often find me working on a craft project. I do lots of embroidery, felt applique, and cross stitch. I also made fun projects like beaded ornaments, origami, and diamond painting. Lately I've been doing lots of painting and began learning how to crochet. You can see my projects on my Instagram.

üêº BritishPandaChick pays tribute to a lot of things. British represents my love of British literature and culture while pandas represent my love of the cuddly creatures. Chick is my tribute to all the usernames I created in the past.

## What I'm Working On
I am started a new series on DEV. It doesn't have a name yet, but the focus is on reviewing coding basics as I tackle a lesson review each day. As 2025 begins, I'll be writing these posts more to review skills I already learned. I'm currenly on a medical break from Coding with Kids, but I hope to be back to teaching in the new year and building more projects with my students.
