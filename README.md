## Roadmap for Second Half of 2025
- get back to building a writing habit. I like to try to write at least 30 minutes a day or edit a post I've already written.
- listen to one podcast episode or read a programming artilce per day. I've been listening to a lot of career books so I'd like to listen to one audiobook per month.
- attend one networking event per month.
- Continue working on tree skirt. I am going to try to do an hour of crafting a day to get it done.
- Get back on the job search or at least research roles I want. 

## What I'm working on now:
- Using LinkedIn Learning to learn more about data and skills related to data analytics.
- Learning Korean in in Drops. Just got a Mango account and have been using that to review concepts I've learned about Drops.
- Publishing one post per week. Switching up my daily post schedule right now.
- Publishing one post per week on LinkedIn. I'm doing my best to make LinkedIn a habit and have been using this platform more than most social media platforms I have.
- Writing 25 minutes using a pomodoro timer.
- Attending Job Hunt Virtual Coffee event on Wednesdays. I'm hoping to join one of the weekly chats soon.
- Slowly working on the tree skirt when I can.
