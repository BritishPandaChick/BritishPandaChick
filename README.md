## Roadmap for Second Half of 2025:
- create a habit of writing regularly. I'm currently trying to write at least 25-30 minutes a day.
- Do one professional development activity per day. This includes listening to a podcast episode, reading a programming article,or listening/reading a career book.
- attend one networking event per month.
- Build a habit of crafting. I am trying to continue working on tree skirt. 
- Get back on the job search or at least research roles I want. 

### Progress Update
- I obtained a library card and have been using the digital resources my library has available. I'm currently using LinkedIn Learning to take different courses and get more certfications. I just obtained one for an introduction to data analytics.
- I'm learning Korean. I am using Drops and Mango from my local library.
- I have been publishing one post per week on DEV. I am still a work in progress on writing regulary, but I still do something writing related (writing or editing) every day for 25 minutes.
- I publish an update on LinkedIn once a week. Sometimes I post a little bit more but I'm trying to use LinkedIn more than any other social media platform.
