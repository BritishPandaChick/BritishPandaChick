# Hello World! I'm Sarah.

I'm a fullstack web developer from Akron, Ohio that specializes in creating the front end elements on web applications, translating web designs into websites using JavaScript and WordPress, and maintaining websites by testing for usability and accessibilty. I am also an online coding instructor at Coding with Kids, an organization that teaches kids coding concepts. I teach Python to students of all ages and coach them through different Python projects. In addition to teaching coding to kids, I have 9 years of teaching exprience mentoring and differentating curriculum to fit individual learning styles of different students. I'm looking to transition into a full time remote front end role that uses JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks so businesses can get online quicker and easily connect with the customers they want to work with.

üíö I served as the moderator of Elphas Can Code from 2019 - 2022. Elphas Can Code was an online community on [Elpha](https://elpha.com/) where all Elpha members learning to code can talk and support each other as they learn how to code.

üè∞ I created the Disney Codes Challenge in 2019. Disney Codes Challenge is a 57 day coding challenge where developers build web projects inspired by Disney each day for 23 minutes. If you are interested in doing the challenge, you can share your progress using the hashtag #DisneyCodesChallenge.

### Fun Facts
üßµ When I'm not coding, you can often find me working on a craft project. I do lots of embroidery, felt applique, and cross stitch. I also made fun projects like beaded ornaments, origami, and diamond painting. You can see my projects on my Instagram.

üêº BritishPandaChick actually pays tribute to a lot of things. British represents my love of British literature and culture while pandas represent my love of pandas. Chick is my tribute to all the usernames I created in the past.
