# Hello World! I'm Sarah.
I am a software engineer from Akron, Ohio that designs and codes web applications. I teach computer science fundamentals and how to build games in Python at Coding with Kids. I write, edit, and publish posts on DEV about coding, tech, and things I've learned on tech.

## Fun FAQs
‚úçÔ∏è I have managed 3 blogs from 2015 - 2021. I created and managed the blogs The Original BritishPandaChick, BritishPandaChick Codes, and Needlework Kits. Today I write posts on DEV. You can follow me on [DEV](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc).

üíö I moderated the Elphas Can Code community on from 2019 - 2022. Elphas Can Code was a space where all Elpha members learning to code can talk and support each other as they learn how to code.

üè∞ I created the Disney Codes Challenge in 2019. Disney Codes Challenge is a 57 day coding challenge where developers build projects inspired by Disney each day for 23 minutes. You can learn more about this challenge with this [post](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-disney-codes-challenge-3ojb).

üßµ You can often find me working on a craft project. I post project progress pictures on Instgram.

üêº BritishPandaChick pays tribute to a lot of things. British represents my love of British literature and culture while pandas represent my love of the cuddly creatures. Chick is my tribute to all the usernames I created in the past.
