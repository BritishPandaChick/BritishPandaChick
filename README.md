- attend one networking event per month.
- finish the tree skirt I started during the first half. Do an hour of crafting a day to get it done.
- Learn a new programming language.
- Get back on the job search or at least research roles I want. 

## What I'm working on now:
- Reviewing SQL and Java using SoloLearn courses.
- Learning Korean in in Drops.
- Publishing one post per week (Look for a new post on Sunday). Currently wrpapping up the CNC2018 Get a Job Challenge series on DEV.
