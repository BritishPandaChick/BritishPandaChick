# Hello World! I'm Sarah.
I am a software developer from Akron, Ohio that specializes in building and editing web appplications that help businesses and customers connect. I teach kids computer science fundamentals and how to create games in Python online at Coding with Kids.

## About Sarah 
‚úçÔ∏è I have managed 3 blogs from 2015 - 2021. Some of the blogs I've managed are The Original BritishPandaChick, BritishPandaChick Codes, and Needlework Kits. Today I write posts on DEV. You can follow me on [DEV](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc).

üíö I served as the moderator of Elphas Can Code from 2019 - 2022. Elphas Can Code was an online community on Elpha where all Elpha members learning to code can talk and support each other as they learn how to code.

üè∞ I created the Disney Codes Challenge in 2019. Disney Codes Challenge is a 57 day coding challenge where developers build projects inspired by Disney each day for 23 minutes. If you are interested in doing the challenge, you can share your progress using the hashtag #DisneyCodesChallenge. You can learn more about this challenge with this [post](https://dev.to/theoriginalbpc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-disney-codes-challenge-3ojb).

üßµ You can often find me working on a craft project. I do lots of embroidery, felt applique, and cross stitch. I also made fun projects like beaded ornaments, origami, and diamond painting. Lately I've been doing lots of painting and began learning how to crochet. You can see my projects on my Instagram.

üêº BritishPandaChick pays tribute to a lot of things. British represents my love of British literature and culture while pandas represent my love of the cuddly creatures. Chick is my tribute to all the usernames I created in the past.

## New Year Roadmap
- Code more = currently reviewing old lessons. Hoping to start a new language by the end of the year. Overall working on easing myself back into coding.
- Write more = currently publishing a post once a week. Trying to be better at writing once a day.
- Build more = would like to get back into the habit of building personal projects again besides stuff for Coding with Kids.
- Professional development = need to start listening more podcasts (i.e. catch up on CodeNewbie for starters!). Currently updating my LinkedIn and resume.
- Back to work at Coding with Kids after a break.
- Continue to work on mental health by being kinder to myself and doing self-care. 

## What I'm Working On
- I submitted a CFP to Virtual Coffee this month for their first virtual conference. I will find out in March if my talk is chosen. 
- I also applied to be a volunteer to Virtual Jane Con this summer. 
- I'm currently re-reviewing PYthon on SoloLearn.
- I started learning Korean on Drops. I'm currently learning Korean numbers.
- Learned how to crochet. Made a gingerbread man and a reindeer. Currently back to felt applique embroidery to see if I can get a project done by July!
