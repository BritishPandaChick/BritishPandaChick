# Hello World, I'm Sarah.

I'm a frontend web developer from Canton, Ohio that specializes in creating the front elements on web applications and translating web designs into websites using JavaScript and WordPress. I'm looking for transition into a full time remote front end role that uses JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks.

## About Sarah 
‚úçÔ∏è I have managed 3 blogs ever since 2015. I managed The Original BritishPandaChick, BritishPandaChick Codes, and Needlework Kits. Now I write posts on Code Newbie and DEV.

üíö I served as the moderator of Elphas Can Code from 2019 - 2022. Elphas Can Code is an online community on [Elpha](https://elpha.com/) where all Elpha members learning to code can talk and support each other as they learn how to code.

üè∞ I created the Disney Codes Challenge in 2019. Disney Codes Challenge is a 57 day coding challenge where developers build web projects inspired by Disney each day for 23 minutes. If you are interested in doing the challenge, you can share your progress using the hashtag #DisneyCodesChallenge.

## Fun Facts
üë©‚Äçüè´ In addition to my coding experience, I have 9 years of teaching experience mentoring and differentiating curriculum to fit individual learning styles. I started working with Coding with Kids in December 2022 where I teach coding skills to elementary and middle school students.

üßµ I do a lot of crafting when I'm not working on code. I do lots of embroidery, felt applique, and cross stitch. I also made fun projects like beaded ornaments, origami, and diamond painting. You can see my projects on my Instagram.

üêº BritishPandaChick actually pays tribute to a lot of things. British represents my love of British literature and culture while pandas represent my love of pandas. Chick is my tribute to all the usernames I created in the past.
